// model is a keyword in prisma schema file and it is used to create a model in the database.
// model name should be in PascalCase and it should be singular and not plural.
// id is a field in the model and it is of type Int and it is a primary key and it is autoincremented
// @id is a directive in prisma schema file and it is used to make a field as primary key
// @default(autoincrement()) is a directive in prisma schema file and it is used to autoincrement the id field
// @default(autoincrement()) is used only for Int type fields.
// so whenever we create a new model a new id will be generated/created automatically

// @unique is a directive in prisma schema file and it is used to make a field as unique
